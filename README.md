SolX is a modern template designed for rapid prototyping and fast iteration with a robust full-stack setup. Built for developers who want to move quickly from idea to production, SolX combines the best tools for speed, flexibility, and maintainability.

## Tech Stack

## Why SolX?

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Start building features immediately—no boilerplate setup required.
- **Modern Best Practices**: Pre-configured with TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and scalable file structure.
